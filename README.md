# Nbody_tutorial

This is a tutorial for the Python N-body code to simulate the propagation of the plume in electrospray thrusters.

The N-body code computes the mutual interactions between each pair of particles in a system composed of N particles (or N bodies).

This tutorial will walk you through: (1) the description of the initial conditions of emission, (2) the description of the external electric field, (3) the fragmentation model, (4) the direct force algorithm to compute the forces applied on each particle, (5) the leap-frog algorithm to update the positions, and (6) the visualization tool to visualize the simulation in 2D and 3D.


# Instructions:

Open the file "tutorial_nbody.ipynb" and follow the tutorial. Each step of the simulation is described within the same file.
At the end of the tutorial, you will be able to generate 2D and 3D animations of the plume of electrospray thrusters.
